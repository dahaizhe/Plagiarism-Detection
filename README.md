# Plagiarism-Detection
This is a simple Django Web application for detecting plagiarism in student homework.

The backend logic is built under MVT pattern of Django, in which M(model) acts as the class abstraction of data tables in the database, T(template) is used to form a readable display of information and V(view) takes charge of the process of assigning the client requests to the specific rendering HTML template.

As for the frontend, Bootstrap makes sure it is easy and friendly for users to visualize the similar part of the text segments and the exact numbers of similar text portions.
