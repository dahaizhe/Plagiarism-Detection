# Plagiarism-Detection
This is a Django Web application for detecting plagiarism in student homework.

## Background

With the rapid development of information technology, students nowadays can easily get access to an enormous amount of data. This could be greatly beneficial for their own literary or academic study. But on the other hand, this could also lead to a more frequent occurrence of plagiarism. 

The backend logic is built under MVT pattern of Django, in which M(model) acts as the class abstraction of data tables in the database, T(template) is used to form a readable display of information and V(view) takes charge of the process of assigning the client requests to the specific rendering HTML template.

As for the frontend, Bootstrap makes sure it is easy and friendly for users to visualize the similar part of the text segments and the exact numbers of similar text portions.
